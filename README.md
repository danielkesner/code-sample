# Nike Coding Challenge

## How to build and run
The only dependencies you need locally to build and run this project are Maven (3.x.x or higher) and Java (1.8 or higher). Follow these steps to build and run this code:

1. Clone this repository locally (`git clone https://github.com/danielkesner/code-sample.git`)
2. Go to the root directly (`niketest`) and build the project with `mvn clean install`.
3. To run the program with a specific user_id, pass it as a parameter to the `run.sh` script, i.e. `./run.sh "6bd5f3c04e6b5279aca633c2a245dd9c"`
